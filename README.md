> **ðŸ“¢ RENAMED**: This package was renamed from `nixmcp` to `mcp-nixos` in version 0.2.0. Update your references accordingly or continue living in the pastâ€”your choice.

## What The Hell Is This Thing?

MCP-NixOS is a Model Context Protocol server that stops your AI assistant from making stuff up about NixOS. Because let's face itâ€”the only thing worse than confusing NixOS documentation is an AI confidently hallucinating about it.

It provides real-time access to:

- NixOS packages (yes, the ones that actually exist)
- System options (the ones you'll spend hours configuring)
- Home Manager settings (for when system-wide chaos isn't enough)
- nix-darwin macOS configurations (because Apple users need complexity too)

## Quick Start: For the Chronically Impatient

Look, we both know you're just going to skim this README and then complain when things don't work. Here's the bare minimum to get started:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nixos": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-nixos"]
    }
  }
}
```

There. Now your AI assistant can actually give you correct information about NixOS instead of hallucinating package names from 2019. You're welcome.

### Environment Variables (For the Paranoid)

Since v1.0.0, the server operates statelessly. No cache directories to fill up your disk, no orphan processes to haunt your system:

| Variable            | Description                              | Default                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `ELASTICSEARCH_URL` | NixOS Elasticsearch API URL             | https://search.nixos.org/backend |

That's it. That's the list. We removed all the complexity because, let's be honest, you weren't going to configure those other variables anyway.

## Features That Might Actually Work

- **NixOS Resources**: Packages and system options via Elasticsearch API
  - Multiple channels: unstable (for the brave), stable (for the boring), and specific versions
  - Detailed package metadata that tells you everything except how to make it work
- **Home Manager**: User configuration options via live HTML parsing
  - Programs, services, and settings you'll spend weekends configuring
  - Hierarchical paths for when you want to get absurdly specific
- **nix-darwin**: macOS configuration for the "I use NixOS BTW" Apple users
  - System defaults, services, and settings Apple never intended you to touch
  - Break your Mac in new and exciting ways!
- **Stateless Operation**: Because state management is overrated
  - No cache to corrupt, no files to clean up
  - Direct API calls every time (your internet better be working)
- **Structured Output**: XML responses that AI models actually understand
  - Clear error messages when things go wrong (and they will)
  - Consistent format across all tools

## MCP Resources & Tools: The Power Tools You Didn't Know You Needed

### NixOS: The OS That Makes You Feel Simultaneously Smarter and Dumber

**Resources:**

- `nixos://package/{name}` - Find that package you're sure exists
- `nixos://search/packages/{query}` - Search for packages that might exist
- `nixos://search/options/{query}` - Search system options you'll misconfig

### Tool Usage Examples (Copy/Paste Ready)

```python
# NixOS examples for when you're pretending to know what you're doing
nixos_search(query="firefox", type="packages", channel="unstable")
nixos_search(query="postgresql", type="options", channel="stable")
nixos_info(name="firefox", type="package")
nixos_info(name="services.postgresql.enable", type="option")

# Home Manager examples for the domestic configuration enthusiasts
home_manager_search(query="programs.git")
home_manager_info(name="programs.firefox.enable")
home_manager_options_by_prefix(option_prefix="programs.git")

# nix-darwin examples for the masochistic Mac users
darwin_search(query="system.defaults.dock")
darwin_info(name="services.yabai.enable")
darwin_options_by_prefix(option_prefix="system.defaults")
```

## Installation & Configuration: The Part You'll Probably Skip

### Install It (Pick Your Poison)

```bash
# Option 1: Install with pip like a normie
pip install mcp-nixos

# Option 2: Install with uv because you're too cool for pip
uv pip install mcp-nixos

# Option 3: Run directly with uvx (recommended for the truly enlightened)
uvx --install-deps mcp-nixos

# Option 4: Install with Nix like a true believer (requires Nix with flakes enabled)
nix profile install github:utensils/mcp-nixos
```

### Configure It (The Part You'll Definitely Mess Up)

Add to your MCP configuration file (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nixos": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-nixos"]
    }
  }
}
```

If you installed using Nix:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nixos": {
      "command": "mcp-nixos"
    }
  }
}
```

Or run directly from GitHub without installing:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nixos": {
      "command": "nix",
      "args": ["run", "github:utensils/mcp-nixos", "--"]
    }
  }
}
```

For development with the source code (for those who enjoy punishment):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nixos": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "-m", "mcp_nixos.__main__"],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cache & Channels: Where Magic Happens and Files Disappear

**Cache System:**

- Default locations that you'll forget about in 5 minutes
- Stores HTML content, serialized data, and search indices
- Works offline once cached (the only feature you'll actually appreciate)

**NixOS Channels:**

- `unstable`: Latest NixOS unstable (for daredevils)
- `stable`: Current stable release (for the risk-averse)
- `24.11`: Specific version reference (for the historically inclined)

## Development: For Those Not Content With Just Using Things

### Dependencies (Now With 40% Less Bloat!)

This project uses `pyproject.toml` and has been on a diet. We went from 5 dependencies to 3:

- `mcp>=1.5.0` - The protocol that makes this all possible
- `requests>=2.32.3` - For talking to APIs like civilized people
- `beautifulsoup4>=4.13.3` - For parsing HTML that shouldn't exist

That's it. No more psutil, no more python-dotenv. We're living lean and mean.

```bash
# Install development dependencies for the brave
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Or with uv (recommended for the enlightened)
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Using Nix (Of Course There's a Nix Development Environment)

```bash
# Enter dev shell and see available commands
nix develop && menu

# Common commands for common folk
run         # Start the server (and your journey into madness)
run-tests   # Run tests with coverage (expose the flaws)
lint        # Format and lint code (fix the mess you made)
publish     # Build and publish to PyPI (share your pain)
```

### Native Nix Package (For True NixOS Enthusiasts)

The project can also be used directly as a Nix package:

```bash
# Build the package without installing it
nix build github:utensils/mcp-nixos

# Run it directly without installing
nix run github:utensils/mcp-nixos

# Install to your user profile
nix profile install github:utensils/mcp-nixos

# Use in your NixOS configuration
{
  inputs.mcp-nixos.url = "github:utensils/mcp-nixos";
  
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, mcp-nixos }: {
    nixosConfigurations.yourhostname = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        ({ pkgs, ... }: {
          environment.systemPackages = [ mcp-nixos.packages.${pkgs.system}.default ];
        })
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

### Testing (Yes, We Actually Do That)

Tests use real Elasticsearch API calls instead of mocks because we're not afraid of the real world:

```bash
# Run tests with coverage (default and recommended)
run-tests

# Run tests without coverage (for those who prefer blissful ignorance)
run-tests --no-coverage
```

Code coverage is tracked on [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/utensils/mcp-nixos) (where we pretend to care about 100% coverage).

## Using with LLMs: The Whole Point of This Exercise

Once configured, use MCP-NixOS in your prompts with MCP-compatible models:

```
# NixOS resources for the confused
~nixos://package/python
~nixos://option/services.nginx
~nixos://search/packages/firefox

# Home Manager resources for the domestically challenged
~home-manager://search/options/programs.git
~home-manager://option/programs.firefox.profiles

# nix-darwin resources for the Apple addicted
~darwin://search/options/system.defaults.dock

# NixOS tools for the tool-inclined
~nixos_search(query="postgresql", type="options")
~nixos_info(name="firefox", type="package", channel="unstable")

# Home Manager tools for home improvement
~home_manager_search(query="programs.zsh")
~home_manager_info(name="programs.git.userName")

# nix-darwin tools for the Mac masochists
~darwin_search(query="services.yabai")
~darwin_info(name="system.defaults.dock.autohide")
```

The LLM will fetch information through the MCP server and might actually give you correct information for once.

## Implementation Details: The 95.7% Smaller House of Cards

### Code Architecture: Less Is More (Or So They Tell Me)

MCP-NixOS v1.0.0 is a masterclass in minimalism. We threw away 95.7% of the code and somehow it still works:

- `mcp_nixos/server.py` - 393 lines of pure, unadulterated functionality
- `mcp_nixos/__main__.py` - 28 lines that just workâ„¢
- That's it. That's the implementation.

Gone are the days of:
- Complex caching layers that nobody understood
- Abstract client interfaces that abstracted nothing
- Context managers managing contexts that didn't need managing
- Utility functions that were neither utilitarian nor functional

### The Great Refactoring of 2025

We went from this:
```
9,755 lines across 47 files in 6 directories
```

To this:
```
416 lines across 2 files that actually matter
```

That's a 95.7% reduction in code, a 100% reduction in complexity, and a 0% reduction in functionality.

### Direct API Integration: No More Middlemen

- **NixOS**: Direct Elasticsearch queries with proper authentication
- **Home Manager**: Live HTML parsing (because they don't have an API)
- **nix-darwin**: More HTML parsing (sensing a pattern here?)

No abstractions, no frameworks, no "enterprise patterns". Just functions that do what they say on the tin.

### Structured XML Output: Because AI Models Are Picky Eaters

Every response is carefully crafted XML that AI models can digest:

```xml
<package_info>
  <name>firefox</name>
  <version>123.0</version>
  <description>A web browser that respects your privacy</description>
</package_info>
```

Clean, consistent, and parseable. Unlike my git commit history.

## What is Model Context Protocol?

### For Those Who Skipped Straight to the End

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is an open protocol that connects LLMs to external data and tools using JSON messages over stdin/stdout. This project implements MCP to give AI assistants access to NixOS, Home Manager, and nix-darwin resources, so they can finally stop making things up about your operating system.
